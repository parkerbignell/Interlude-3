# Interlude 3 
## Reflection
The main message of this module is that some forms of computer programming are much more difficult than others, but it is important to note that the more you learn about computer prgoramming and engineering, the better you can develop it to make it work for you. Prior to this Module, I had never made my own sound sample, nor used NetLogo Web. What I learned from the OpenAI API resource was how one could use its capabilities to create their own comic strip, just like we did. I used material like this before, just not this exact type of programming. This Module prepares me for the Unessay because it can provide me with additional material I need to make my contribution to my groups' work far exceed class expectations. For example, if a soundbite of background stock footage of running water or a airplane needs to accompany the work, I would know exactly how to program it in. 
The role of the historian is to use materials like these to further develop and expand on broader, more interesting forms of history. I have mentioned in previous interludes for previous Modules, the subject matter touched on in this course allows for historians to find broader better ways to teach young people about history, as well as actively get them engaged in the medium. In our first Module, we talked about the importance of Twine and creating our own juorneys with its properties. The same can be said for OpenAI API, which has the ability to allow historians to describe historical events through the use of creative storytelling. In my Twine assignment, I talked about the Battle of Wake Island in December 1941. If possible, I could have told a story based on the information I provided in my Twine experiment to further document the hisotrical properties of everything.

## Log
Admittedly, I suffered a delayed start date on this Module, as I tested positive for COVID-19 the week of November 14th. Despite that, I managed to use all the technology required of us throughout. Firstly, I taughy myself how to use OpenAI API by doing the questions asked of me to do for the instructions laid out for me. I ultimately decided to base my project creation on two archaeologist characters, Bob and Jane going to the middle of a desert to excavate, on a rather sunny day. I selected a still image online to use as the basis for my creation, while sending text messages to myself to make dialogue bubbles. I took a screenshot of each one, cropped it and sent them from my phone to the computer where I pasted them from my Apple iPhone attached file onto my comic strip. It took me a while to do this, as I had to keep manuvering the images around to make them easy to follow. I only hoped I could make my design look as creative as possible, as I could only use one image in my comic strip, and since I did not know how to render an image on the actual website, I thought finding one online would suffice. 
On the 23rd, I attempted to make my own sound rendering of a plane taking off. As I had trouble rendering the necessary sound file, I decided to base it off a sample of running water, which I believed sounded similar to it. I tried to change the code on the file, as we were told to do on the board by Professor Graham. After doing it, I did not really notice a difference between the original water file and the one I had made, but since I could tell the file had not crashed nor was not marked as "incomplete", I felt as though I had designed a worthy sound file.
On the final instructional day of the course, I did my best to create my own map in NetLogo Web. After struggling with the information with my fellow classmates, I thankfully received the link from the Professor Graham on how to properly add in the necessary information and coordinates in order to generate the map he was showing on the board. I then entered in sizable coordinates and information into the NetLogo Code to make a comprehendable finished product.
