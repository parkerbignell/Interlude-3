# Interlude 3 
## Reflection
The main message of this module is that some forms of computer programming are more difficult than others, but it is important to note the more someone learns about computer programming and engineering, the better they can develop it to make it work for them. Prior to this Module, I had never made my own sound sample, nor used NetLogo Web. What I learned from the OpenAI API resource was how one could use its capabilities to create their own comic strip, just like the class did. I had used software like this before, but not with this exact type of programming. This Module prepares me for the Unessay because it can provide me with additional material I need to make my contribution to my groups' work far exceed class expectations. For example, if a soundbite of background stock footage of running water or an airplane needs to accompany the work, I would know exactly how to program it in. The ability to generate a world on NetLogo is important, as it taught me about the different dimensions and aesthetics an online world must have in order to configure properly and look presentable.  
The role of the historian is to use materials like these to further develop and expand on broader, more interesting forms of history. I have mentioned in Interludes for previous Modules, the subject matter in this course allows for historians to find new and innovative ways to teach young people about history, as well as actively get them engaged in the online medium. In our first Module, we talked about the importance of Twine and creating our own juorneys with its properties. The same can be said for OpenAI API, which has the ability to allow historians to describe historic events through the use of creative storytelling. In my Twine assignment, I talked about the Battle of Wake Island in December 1941. Thus, I could have told a story based on the information I provided in my Twine experiment to further document the hisotric properties of the battle on OpenAI API.
In our second Module, we worked with software designed to deal with and alter the Geolocation of a still image in order to make it move around. That is similar to what we did the week of November 30th, where we tried to configure our own NetLogo Web maps complete with their own configurations and codes. Both of these designs were forms of coding, which can help further develop the importance and vitality of the changing mediums that people view history through. Both times I was told to configure the codes to make the finished product work. Without the right coordinates, the images on both projects would have been unable to configure properly. These are two things historians must know if they want to digitize old files in order to bring old forms of history into the modern era. 
Historians and scholars have effortlessly tried to argue for the importance of archaeogaming and online simulations of historic interpretations in today's everchanging world. One wise historian, by the name of Shawn Graham mentions "if archaeogaming is going to be a serious pursuit, then the first lesson we can take from agent based modelling concerns time and space. The way that time is treated in agent based models is critical: time is malleable so that there is time for something to take place. It makes a difference to your model whether or not your agents update themselves one-at-a-time, each one running its procedures sequentially, versus in parallel. Emergent effects that can seem profound or meaningful might only be an artefact on how 'time' is imagined. Then there is the time within which something might take place".1
Professor Graham elaborates on my point by proving there needs to be some kind of element of the past that connects to the developing of a historically-based gameplay, in order to better connect and communicate with what the overarcing structure of the programming of the coding software and gameplay are trying to convey. Only then can historical representations flow freely through the Information Superhighway. Otherwise the system will fall apart and no one will be able to understand, nor bother to learn about what makes archaeogaming so unique in the world of today, causing an entire medium of interpretations to fall out of play.  
## Log
Admittedly, I suffered a delayed start date on this Module, as I tested positive for COVID-19 the week of November 14th. Despite that, I managed to use all the technology required of the course throughout in order to make up for it. Firstly, I taught myself how to use OpenAI API by doing the questions asked of me on the website. I decided to base my project creation on two archaeologist characters, Bob and Jane, who were going to the middle of a desert to perform an excavation on a rather sunny day. I selected a still image online to use as the basis for my creation, while sending text messages to myself to make dialogue bubbles. I took a screenshot of each one, cropped it and sent them from my phone to the computer where I pasted them from my Apple iPhone attached file onto my comic strip. It took me a while to do this, as I had to keep manuvering the images around to make them easy to follow. I attempted to make my work look as creative as possible, as I could only use one still image, as I did not know how to render images on the actual OpenAI API website. 
On November 23rd, I attempted to make my own sound rendering of a plane taking off. As I had trouble rendering the necessary sound file, I decided to base it off a sample of running water, which I believed sounded similar to it. I tried to change the code on the file, as we were told to do on the board by Professor Graham. After doing it, I did not really notice a difference between the original water file and the one I had made, but since I could tell the file had not crashed nor was not marked as "incomplete", I believed I had designed a worthy sound file.
On the final instructional day of the course, I did my best to create my own map in NetLogo Web. After struggling with the information alongside my fellow classmates, I thankfully received the link from the Professor Graham on how to properly add in the necessary information and coordinates in order to generate the map he was showing on the board. I then entered in sizable coordinates and information into the NetLogo Code to make a comprehendable finished product.
